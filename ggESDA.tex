\Abstract{
  This paper presents the \pkg{ggESDA} package, which we developed for exploratory symbolic data analysis in \proglang{R}. Based on \pkg{ggplot2} \cite{Wickham:2009}, the \pkg{ggESDA} package which is familiar programming structure with its parent provides a wide variety of graphical techniques such as histogram, 3D-scatterplot and radar plot. In addition, a general and  customized transformation function \code{classic2sym()} is implemented for generating a symbolic data table from classical data frame by clustering algorithm, \pkg{RSDA} \cite{Rojas:2015} function and user-defined method. wait for edit......

\section{Introduction}
"In Data Science the aim is to extract new knowledge from Standard, Big, and complex data. Often these data are unstructured with variables defined on different kinds of units. They can also be multi-sources (as mixtures of numerical and textual data, with images and networks)." \cite{Diday:2018}. The statement indicates that not only conventional data but the unstructured data, also known as symbolic data, is important for data science. Rather than the classical data represented by a single value, symbolic data with measurements on $p$ random variables can be $p$-dimensional statistical units such as hypercubes or histograms.
